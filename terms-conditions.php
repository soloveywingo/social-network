                <h2>Terms and Conditions</h2>
                <p>1. Choose carefully with whom to be friends. Accepting the request to add a friend to a person you do
                    not know anything about is simply meaningless. Friends form the basic group of any social network,
                    which is why the choice of friends should be as accurate as possible. Remember that you can be
                    good-natured and do not mind meeting anyone, but the motives of people you do not know who you add
                    to friends may be different from yours.</p>

                <p>2. Do not combine personal and professional. Always try to make sure that personal and professional
                    accounts are different. Obviously, you do not want all your colleagues at work to be aware of
                    everything that happens in your personal life. And friends are unlikely to be interested in your
                    professional affairs. Therefore, it is best to use two different social networks or at least two
                    different accounts for personal and professional use.</p>

                <p>3. Comment with the mind. Commenting or blogging is an integral part of any social network. You need
                    to pay special attention to your comments, because everyone in your list of friends will know your
                    opinion. Do not leave comments that can offend someone else, in general, be kind and condescending
                    to "your friends." 4. Be careful when sharing images - You should be careful when you share images
                    or publish them on social networks. If in the image another person, before publishing such an image,
                    ask permission. If the photo is inappropriate, it should not be published. Publish your own and
                    others' photos, you need to be very careful.</p>

                <p>5. Do not post when you are tired, angry or upset. I think everyone will agree with me that you
                    should not publish records when you are tired, angry or upset. It happens that you state your
                    feelings or hatred for some person, and then regret it.</p>

                <p>6. Respect the decision of another person when he refuses your request to be added to friends. If
                    someone refuses to you in friendship, do not take it to heart. This is another person's decision,
                    and you must respect it. Remember that you can also deny someone friendship, so this is just a
                    decision that should be respected.</p>

                <p>7. Provide correct basic information. Always provide the right basic information where and when it is
                    required. This is especially important in a professional network in which people contact you
                    depending on your basic information. It can also be very useful if you for some reason have lost
                    access to your account, well, or someone hacked it and you will need to confirm that it is you who
                    are its true and legitimate owner.</p>

                <p>8. Do not become addicted to social networks. The last but not the least important point is that you
                    should avoid dependence on social networks. Social networks can be a part of your life, but not all
                    life, although this is often the case today.</p>

                <p>It should be understood that social networks simply allow you to do certain things more effectively.
                    In general, these rules are easy to adhere to.</p>
